{ 
    "datasetName": "landsat_band_files_c2_l1",
    "metadataType": ["shp", "full"],
    "fileGroupIds": ["ls_c2l1_all"]
}

=> Is fileGroupIds something I need?

For idea for subprograms... (callusgs search; callusgs download; callusgs geocode; etc.)

---------------
after querying downloads and retrieving the URL file sizes etc. it is crucial to remember the downloadId and call download_remove afterwards to remove respective downloads from list
    download_search is also important for that - porbably
-----
might actually need to perform all downloads via BULK download
-----
set user context in CLI tools
-----
get username and password via environment variables (sys.getenv())
-----
You have to specifically ask for certain datasets -> CHECK IF I CAN DOWNLOAD OTHERS NONETHELESS!
