GENERAL:
- [ ] respect API limits (see 1); this does not quite work out with retries etc. given the current implementation

1. handle rate limits (HTTP 429) gracefully
2. create a custom type for the preferences? Probably not, dict is fine in this context
4. can I set myself as a download application? I.e. "callusgs"
