GENERAL:
- [] type hint payload dictionaries as dicts?
- [] in CLI applications, check permissions for ["order", "download"] immediately after logging in; if they're not present, remind user they have to request access under "Request access to the M2M API from your ERS profile: https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/profile/access"
- [] set content type to "application/json" in _call_post method or maybe even in __init__ and then update this dictionary on login/logout?! Might actually make more sense tbh
- [] set timeout to recommended value..
- [] implement missing/undocumented API endpoints: download-options, order-products, download-request
- [] 

1. handle rate limits (HTTP 429) gracefully
2. create a custom type for the preferences? Probably not, dict is fine in this context
4. can I set myself as a download application? I.e. "callusgs"
5. check if downloaded file size equals expected file size
